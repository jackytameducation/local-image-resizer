## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Module not found**: Make sure you've installed requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Permission errors**: Ensure the app has write permissions in the project directory

3. **Large files**: Very large images may take longer to process

4. **Network timeouts**: URLs may fail if the image server is slow or unreachable
